# agentic-ui-toy

this app is going to be for agentic ai. the user will be able to edit the prompt of each agent and also spawn in more agents. the goal of the toy prototype you are making is to enable the user to setup very basic multi shot agentic ui chains. You should be able to:

- delete, edit and re-order agents.
- Edit the prompt for them.
- choose which agent it fires off after it has done its processing
- suggest templates for quick setup like "Help decide on how to approach homework"
